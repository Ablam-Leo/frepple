frePPLe - open source supply chain planning
===========================================

FrePPLe is an easy-to-use and easy-to-implement open source *advanced planning
and scheduling* tool.

When spreadsheets doesn't suffice any longer to adequately plan and schedule
your production, frePPLe allows in an easy and cost-efficient way to generate
a more optimized plan.

FrePPLe implements planning algoritms based on best practices such as *theory
of constraints* (ie plan around the bottleneck), *pull-based planning* (ie start
production as late as possible and directly triggered by demand) and *lean
manufacturing* (ie avoid intermediate delays and inventory).
