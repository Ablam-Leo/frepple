Full demand visibility throughout the supply chain
==================================================

The link to customer demand should be visible at any level in the supply chain. 

With correct tools and processes in place a change in a sales forecast you 
should be able to very quickly see the impact on the requirements on your 
suppliers.

Similarly, when a supplier notifies you of a disruption in his supply you 
should be able to very quickly analyze the impact on the customer demand.
This capability is a true enabler of agile planning process.
How long does it currently take you to propagate this information?

This bidirectional flow of information is key for a transparent and consistent 
planning process, and enables efficient collaboration and communication
across the supply chain.

Don't do / anti-pattern:
Buy components based on the average consumption over the last x periods.  
The link between the purchasing plan and the forecast is then broken. 
You're effectively driving a car by looking in the rear view mirror. 
This approach will fail to plan correctly for new product introductions
or product mix changes.
