Planning principles
===================

FrePPLe is based on set of key principles which we believe to be at the heart of a clear and 
consistent planning process of the entire value chain across an organization, its suppliers
and its clients.

Understanding these principles is an important step in fitting frePPLe to your business.

1. The link to customer demand (either an actual sales order or a forecasted demand) 
   should be visible at any level in the supply chain.

2. A sales forecast requires input of different department of a company: sales, 
   marketing, top management, production, product development... 
   They should efficiently work together on the same set of numbers

3. Forecast consumption reconciles sales orders and sales forecast in a complete and
   consistent demand picture that covers the complete horizon.

4. Strategic decoupling points in the supply carry inventory to protect against
   variability, both from supply and demand sides.

5. An intuitive color coding scheme focuses the planner on the topics requiring
   attention.  

6. A finite-capacity plan should consider the material, capacity, lead time 
   constraints and their interaction.

7. A tool that correctly combines and integrates all of the above principles will bring
   a big value to a company.
