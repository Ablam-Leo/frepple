Filtering data
==============

All screens display a filter icon in the tool bar on the upper left. Clicking
the icon pops up a small window where you can specify the filters. The filter
expression can use any of the attributes in the screen, and combine them with
AND or OR conditions.

When the displayed data are filtered, the applied filters are shown above
the data. The filter values can be edited, which allows quick re-filtering.

Filters you frequently use can be saved as a favorite. Favorite filters are
accessible with the star icon in the tool bar on the upper left. Favorites
are private for each user.
